# [Hackathon for Wildlife](https://adamgraham.io/games/hackathon-for-wildlife)

> On November 14th and 15th over 60 people came together to explore and develop innovative ways to engage worldwide audiences with wild animals. The hackathon teams created amazing concepts through a combination of technologies that include GPS hardware, data, games, and social media to create a stronger, more vested connection between people and animals.

An empathetic game created in 24 hours that invokes the emotions an elephant feels while being hunted by a deadly poacher. By putting the player in the role of the elephant, it creates a deeper connection between the human and the animal.
